# LeadGen AI ðŸ‘¾
Leadgen AI is a powerful tool that lets you extract data from any website URL with ease.

# Leadgen AI: How It Works

### Initial Build
Started with a script using Selenium (for dynamic pages) and Beautiful Soup to scrape contact info (emails, phone numbers) and social media links from any URL.

### Data Cleanup
Cleaned and formatted the scraped data, splitting it into chunks to stay within LLM token limits.

### LLM Integration (Llama 3.1)
Chose Llama 3.1 for its speed and cost-efficiency. It analyzes scraped content and generates personalized outreach (cold emails, LinkedIn requests, follow-ups) based on user prompts.

### API & Sheet Integration
Built a FastAPI backend and connected it to Google Sheets via Apps Script for seamless usage.

### Smart Sidebar in Sheets
Integrated a chat sidebar where users can select templates or enter custom promptsâ€”Llama 3.1 handles the messaging instantly.

### Performance

Scraping Accuracy: ~90% (manual testing)

Speed: 2â€“5s for scraping, 7â€“10s for responses

Impact: Cuts outreach drafting time by ~70%

# ðŸš€ How to Run Leadgen AI

### 1. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 2. Set Up Google Sheets Integration

- Open your Google Sheet

- Go to Extensions â†’ Apps Script

- Open the google-sheets directory from the repo

- Copy and paste the script into the Apps Script editor and save

### 3. Start the API Server

Run the FastAPI server locally:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
### 4. Expose Locally with ngrok
Make your local server publicly accessible:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```
### 5. Use in Google Sheets
Paste URLs into your sheet. Then use the custom formula to extract data:

```excel
=EXTRACT_DATA(urlrange, fieldrange)
```
Example:

```excel
=EXTRACT_DATA(A2:A4, B1:E1)
```
This will scrape the URLs in A2:A4 and return the fields specified in B1:E1.
